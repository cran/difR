-----------------------------------
- Changes in diR 1.1 (2009-10-27) -
-----------------------------------

  o  The output of 'itemPar2PL' function was corrected to fix a bug. The parameter 
     estimates of the item difficulties were actually not returned as item 
     difficulties (in the IRT sense) but as additive intercept parameters as 
     described in the help file of the 'ltm' function of the eponym package. 
     Version 1.1 of difR was corrected to return the correct item difficulty 
     estimates. Note that functions 'itemPar1PL', 'itemPar3PL' and 'itemPar3PLconst'
     were not affected by this bug.

  o  The listing of the authors was corrected in the reference manual to fix a 
     printing mistake.

  o  Several R codes in the Example sections have been preceded by the '#' symbol,
     so that they are not executed when copy-pasting the full R code from these
     sections. However, the R code itself remains functioning but it was not executed
     during the building of the difR package version 1.1. Anyone interested in seeing
     how the command works has just to copy-paste the R code without the '#' symbol.
     This is mentioned in the help files by the '(remove #)' message.
