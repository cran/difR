\arguments{
 \item{Data}{numeric: either the data matrix only, or the data matrix plus the vector of group membership. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{group}{numeric or character: either the vector of group membership or the column indicator (within \code{data}) of group membership. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{focal.name}{numeric or character indicating the level of \code{group} which corresponds to the focal group.}
 \item{stdWeight}{character: the type of weights used for the standardized P-DIF statistic. Possible values are \code{"focal"} (default),
                  \code{"reference"} and \code{"total"}. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{thr}{numeric: the threshold (cut-score) for standardized P-DIF statistic (default is 0.10).}

\value{
A list of class "PDIF" with the following arguments:
  \item{PDIF}{the values of the standardized P-DIF statistics.}

  \item{alpha}{the value of \code{alpha} argument.}

  \item{difPur}{a binary matrix with one row per iteration in the item purification process and one column per item. Zeros and ones in the \emph{i}-th 
   row refer to items which were classified respectively as non-DIF and DIF items at the (\emph{i}-1)-th step. The first row corresponds to the initial
   classification of the items. Returned only if \code{purify} is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{convergence}{logical indicating whether the iterative item purification process stopped before the maximal number \code{nrIter} of allowed iterations. 
  Returned only if \code{purify} is \code{TRUE}.}

\details{
 The method of standardization (Dorans and Kullick, 1986) allows for detecting uniform differential item functioning 
 without requiring an item response model approach.
 
 The \code{Data} is a matrix whose rows correspond to the subjects and columns to the items. Missing values are not allowed.
 In addition, \code{Data} can hold the vector of group membership. If so, \code{group} indicates the column of \code{Data} which 
 corresponds to the group membership, either by specifying its name or by giving the column number. Otherwise,
 \code{group} must be a vector of same length as \code{nrow(Data)}.
 
 The vector of group membership must hold only two different values, either as numeric or character. The focal group is defined by
 the value of the argument \code{focal.name}. 
 
 The threshold (or cut-score) for classifying items as DIF has to be set by the user by the argument \code{thr}. Default value is 0.10 
 but Dorans (1989) also recommends value 0.05. For this reason it is not possible to provide asymptotic \emph{p}-values.

 The weights for computing the standardized P-DIF statistics are defined through the argument \code{stdWeight}, with possible values
 \code{"focal"} (default value), \code{"reference"} and \code{"total"}. See \code{\link{stdPDIF}} for further details.
 
 In addition, two types of effect sizes are displayed. The first one is obtained from the standardized P-DIF statistic itself.
 According to Dorans, Schmitt and Bleistein (1992), the effect size of an item is classified as negligible if \eqn{|St-P-DIF| \leq 0.05},
 moderate if \eqn{0.05 \leq |St-P-DIF| \leq 0.10}, and large if if \eqn{|St-P-DIF| \geq 0.10}. The second one is based on the transformation
 to the ETS Delta Scale (Holland and Thayer, 1985) of the standardized 'alpha' values (Dorans, 1989; Holland, 1985). The values of the 
 effect sizes, together with the Dorans, Schmitt and Bleistein (DSB) and the ETS Delta sclae (ETS) classsification, are printed with the output.

 Item purification can be performed by setting \code{purify} to \code{TRUE}. Purification works as follows: if at least one item was detected as functioning 
 differently at some step of the process, then the data set of the next step consists in all items that are currently anchor (DIF free) items, plus the 
 tested item (if necessary). The process stops when either two successive applications of the method yield the same classifications of the items (Clauser and Mazor, 1998),
 or when \code{nrIter} iterations are run without obtaining two successive identical classifications. In the latter case a warning message is printed.
