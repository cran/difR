\details{
 The logistic regression method (Swaminathan and Rogers, 1990) allows for detecting both uniform and non-uniform differential item functioning 
 without requiring an item response model approach. It consists in fitting a logistic model with the test score,
 the group membership and an interaction between both as covariates. The statistical significance of the parameters
 related to group membership and the group-score interaction is then evaluated by means of either the likelihood-ratio
 test or the Wald test. The argument \code{type} permits to test either both uniform and nonuniform effects simultaneously (\code{type="both"}), only uniform
 DIF effect (\code{type="udif"}) or only nonuniform DIF effect (\code{type="nudif"}). The argument \code{criterion} permits to select either
 the likelihood ratio test (\code{criterion=="LRT"}) or the Wald test (\code{criterion=="Wald"}). See \code{\link{Logistik}} for further details.
 
 The \code{Data} is a matrix whose rows correspond to the subjects and columns to the items. Missing values are not allowed.
 In addition, \code{Data} can hold the vector of group membership. If so, \code{group} indicates the column of \code{Data} which 
 corresponds to the group membership, either by specifying its name or by giving the column number. Otherwise,
 \code{group} must be a vector of same length as \code{nrow(Data)}.
 
 The vector of group membership must hold only two different values, either as numeric or character. The focal group is defined by
 the value of the argument \code{focal.name}. 
 
 The threshold (or cut-score) for classifying items as DIF is computed as the quantile of the chi-square distribution with lower-tail
 probability of one minus \code{alpha} and with one (if \code{type="udif"} or \code{type="nudif"}) or two (if \code{type="both"}) degrees of freedom.
 
 Item purification can be performed by setting \code{purify} to \code{TRUE}. Purification works as follows: if at least one item is detected as functioning 
 differently at the first step of the process, then the data set of the next step consists in all items that are currently anchor (DIF free) items, plus the 
 tested item (if necessary). The process stops when either two successive applications of the method yield the same classifications of the items
 (Clauser and Mazor, 1998), or when \code{nrIter} iterations are run without obtaining two successive identical classifications. In the latter case
 a warning message is printed. 

 The measures of effect size are provided by the difference \eqn{\Delta R^2} between the \eqn{R^2} coefficients of the two nested models (Nagelkerke, 1991; 
 Gomez-Benito, Dolores Hidalgo and Padilla, 2009). The effect sizes are classified as "negligible", "moderate" or "large". Two scales are available, one from
 Zumbo and Thomas (1997) and one from Jodoign and Gierl (2001). The output displays the \eqn{\Delta R^2} measures, together with the two classifications.

 Two types of plots are available. The first one is obtained by setting \code{plot="lrStat"} and it is the default option. The likelihood ratio statistics are displayed 
 on the Y axis, for each item. The detection threshold is displayed by a horizontal line, and items flagged as DIF are printed with the color defined by argument \code{col}.
 By default, items are spotted with their number identification (\code{number=TRUE}); otherwise they are simply drawn as dots whose form is given by the option \code{pch}.

 The other type of plot is obtained by setting \code{plot="itemCurve"}. In this case, the fitted logistic curves are displayed for one specific item set by the argument 
 \code{item}. The latter argument can hold either the name of the item or its number identification. When one tests for nonuniform DIF (\code{type="nudif"}), two logistic
 curves are displayed, either parallel (if the item is not flagged as DIF) or with different slopes (if the item is flagged as DIF). When one tests for both DIF effects
 (\code{type="both"}) or only uniform DIF (\code{type="udif"}), only one logistic curve is drawn if the item is not flagged as DIF; otherwise, two curves are displayed
 with a corresponding legend (in the upper left corner). The colors and types of traits for these curves are defined by means of the arguments \code{colIC} and \code{ltyIC}
 respectively. These are set as vectors of length 2, the first element for the reference group and the second for the focal group.
