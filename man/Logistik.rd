\details{
 This command computes the logistic regression statistic (Swaminathan and Rogers, 1990) in the specific framework of differential item functioning. 
 It forms the basic command of \code{\link{difLogistic}} and is specifically designed for this call.
 
 The three possible models to be fitted are:

 \deqn{M_0: logit (\pi_g) = \alpha + \beta X + \gamma_g + \delta_g X}
 \deqn{M_1: logit (\pi_g) = \alpha + \beta X + \gamma_g}
 \deqn{M_2: logit (\pi_g) = \alpha + \beta X}

 where \eqn{\pi_g} is the probability of answering correctly the item in group \emph{g} and \eqn{X} is the sum score. Parameters \eqn{\alpha} and 
 \eqn{\beta} are the intercept and the slope of the logistic curves (common to all groups), while \eqn{\gamma_g} and \eqn{\delta_g} are group-specific
 parameters. For identification reasons the parameters \eqn{\gamma_0} and \eqn{\delta_0} for reference group (\eqn{g=0}) are set to zero. The parameter
 \eqn{\gamma_1} of the focal group (\eqn{g=1}) represents the uniform DIF effect, and the parameter \eqn{\delta_1} is used to model nonuniform DIF 
 effect. The models are fitted with the \code{\link{glm}} function.

 Two types of DIF statistics can be computed: the likelihood ratio test statistics, obtained by comparing the fit of two nested models,
 and the Wald statistics, obtained with an appropriate contrast matrix for testing the model parameters (Johnson and Wichern, 1998).
 These are specified by the argument \code{criterion}, with respective values \code{"LRT"} and \code{"Wald"}. By default, the LRT
 statistics are computed.

 If \code{criterion} is \code{"LRT"}, the argument \code{type} determines the models to be compared by means of the LRT statistics.
 The three possible values of \code{type} are: \code{type="both"} (default) which tests the hypothesis \eqn{H_0: \gamma_1 = \delta_1=0} by comparing models 
 \eqn{M_0} and \eqn{M_2}; \code{type="nudif"} which tests the hypothesis \eqn{H_0: \delta_1 = 0} by comparing models \eqn{M_0} and \eqn{M_1}; and \code{type="udif"}
 which tests the hypothesis \eqn{H_0: \gamma_1 = 0} by comparing models \eqn{M_1} and \eqn{M_2} (assuming that \eqn{\delta_1 = 0}). In other words, \code{type="both"}
 tests for DIF (without distinction between uniform and nonuniform effects), while \code{type="udif"} and \code{type="nudif"} test for uniform and nonuniform DIF,
 respectively. 

 If \code{criterion} is \code{"Wald"}, the argument \code{type} determines the logistic model to be considered and the appropriate contrast matrix. 
 If \code{type=="both"}, the considered model is model \eqn{M_0} and the contrast matrix has two rows, (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1). If \code{type=="nudif"}, 
 the considered model is also model \eqn{M_0} but the contrast matrix has only one row, (0,0,0,1). Eventually, if \code{type=="udif"}, the considered model
 is model \eqn{M_1} and the contrast matrix has one row, (0,0,1). 

 The data are passed through the \code{data} argument, with one row per subject and one column per item. Missing values are allowed but must be coded as \code{NA}
 values. They are discarded from the fitting of the logistic models (see \code{\link{glm}} for further details).
  
 The vector of group membership, specified with \code{member} argument, must hold only zeros and ones, a value of zero corresponding to the
 reference group and a value of one to the focal group.

 Option \code{anchor} sets the items which are considered as anchor items for computing logistic regression DIF statistics. Items other than the anchor 
 items and the tested item are discarded. \code{anchor} must hold integer values specifying the column numbers of the corresponding anchor items. It is 
 mainly designed to perform item purification.

 The output contains: the selected DIF statistics (either the LRT or the Wald statistic) computed for each item, and two matrices with the parameter estimates of
 both models, for each item. In addition, Nagelkerke's \eqn{R^2} coefficients (Nagelkerke, 1991) are computed for each model and the output returns the differences
 in these coefficients. Such differences are used as measures of effect size by the \code{\link{difLogistic}} command; see Gomez-Benito, Dolores Hidalgo and Padilla
 (2009), Jodoin and Gierl (2001) and Zumbo and Thomas (1997). The \code{criterion} argument is also returned.
