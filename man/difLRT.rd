\description{
 Performs DIF detection using Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) method.
}

\usage{
 difLRT(Data, group, focal.name, alpha=0.05, purify=FALSE, 
 nrIter=10)
 \method{print}{LRT}(x, ...)
 \method{plot}{LRT}(x, pch=8, number=TRUE, col="red", ...)
}

\arguments{
 \item{Data}{numeric: either the data matrix only, or the data matrix plus the vector of group membership. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{group}{numeric or character: either the vector of group membership or the column indicator (within \code{data}) of group membership. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{focal.name}{numeric or character indicating the level of \code{group} which corresponds to the focal group.}
 \item{alpha}{numeric: significance level (default is 0.05).}
 \item{purify}{logical: should the method be used iteratively to purify the set of anchor items? (default is FALSE).}
 \item{nrIter}{numeric: the maximal number of iterations in the item purification process. Default is 10.}
 \item{x}{the result from a \code{LRT} class object.}
 \item{pch, col}{type of usual \code{pch} and \code{col} graphical options.}
 \item{number}{logical: should the item number identification be printed (default is \code{TRUE}).}
 \item{...}{other generic parameters for the \code{plot} or the \code{print} functions.}
}

\value{
A list of class "LRT" with the following arguments:
  \item{LRT}{the values of the likelihood-ratio statistics.}
  \item{alpha}{the value of \code{alpha} argument.}
  \item{thr}{the threshold (cut-score) for DIF detection.}
  \item{DIFitems}{either the items which were detected as DIF items, or "No DIF item detected".}
  \item{purification}{the value of \code{purify} option.} 
  \item{nrPur}{the number of iterations in the item purification process. Returned only if \code{purify} is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{convergence}{logical indicating whether the iterative item purification process stopped before the maximal number of allowed iterations
   (10 by default). Returned only if \code{purify} is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{names}{the names of the items.}
 }

\details{
 The likelihood-ratio test method (Thissen, Steinberg and Wainer, 1988) allows for detecting uniform differential item functioning 
 by fitting a closed-form Rasch model and by testing for extra interactions between group membership and item response. Currently only 
 the Rasch model can be used, so only uniform DIF can be detected. Moreover, items are tested one by one and the other items act as
 anchor items.

 The \code{Data} is a matrix whose rows correspond to the subjects and columns to the items. Missing values are not allowed.
 In addition, \code{Data} can hold the vector of group membership. If so, \code{group} indicates the column of \code{Data} which 
 corresponds to the group membership, either by specifying its name or by giving the column number. Otherwise, \code{group} must 
 be a vector of same length as \code{nrow(Data)}.
 
 The vector of group membership must hold only two different values, either as numeric or character. The focal group is defined by
 the value of the argument \code{focal.name}. 
 
 The function \code{glmer} from package \code{lme4} (Bates and Maechler, 2009) is used to fit the closed-form Rasch model. More precisely, the probability that 
 response \eqn{Y_{ijg}} of subject \emph{i} from group \emph{g} (focal or reference) to item \emph{j} is modeled as

 \deqn{logit (Pr(Y_{ijg}=1) = \theta_{ig} + \gamma_g - \beta_j}

 where \eqn{\theta_i} is subject's ability, \eqn{\beta_j} is the item difficulty and \eqn{\gamma_g} is the difference mean ability level between
 the focal and the reference groups. Subject abilities are treated as random effects, while item difficulties and \eqn{\gamma_g} are treated as fixed effects.
 Each item is tested by incorporating an interaction term, \eqn{\delta_{gj}}, and by testing its statistical significance using the traditional
 likelihood-ratio test.

 The threshold (or cut-score) for classifying items as DIF is computed as the quantile of the chi-square distribution with lower-tail
 probability of one minus \code{alpha} and one degree of freedom.
 
 Item purification can be performed by setting \code{purify} to \code{TRUE}. In this case, items detected as DIF are iteratively
 removed from the set of tested items, and the procedure is repeated (using the remaining items) until no additionnal item is
 identified as functioning differently. The process stops when either there is no new item detected as DIF, or when \code{nrIter} iterations 
 are run and new DIF items are nevertheless detected. In the latter case a warning message is printed. 
}

\note{
 Because of the fitting of the modified Rasch model with \code{glmer}, the process can be very time consuming.
